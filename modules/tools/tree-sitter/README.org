* Description
# A summary of what this module does.
=:tools tree-sitter= sets up an Emacs binding for [[https://tree-sitter.github.io/][Tree-sitter]], an incremental
parsing system.

From the [[https://ubolonton.github.io/emacs-tree-sitter/][main package author]]:
#+begin_quote
It aims to be the foundation for a new breed of Emacs packages that understand
code structurally. For example:

  - Faster, fine-grained code highlighting.
  - More flexible code folding.
  - Structural editing (like Paredit, or even better) for non-Lisp code.
  - More informative indexing for imenu.

The author of Tree-sitter articulated its merits a lot better in this Strange Loop talk.

Tree sitter provides a lot more granular and language-specific faces. If you
want to remap some of them you can either customize the
=tree-sitter-hl-face:CAPTURE-NAME= face or advice the
=tree-sitter-hl-face-mapping-function= function as in the examples in
[[https://ubolonton.github.io/emacs-tree-sitter/syntax-highlighting/customization/#face-mappings][emacs-tree-sitter docs]]
